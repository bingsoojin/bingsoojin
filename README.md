- 👋 Hi, I’m @bingsoojin

- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code, basic python learner atm and my classes are taking me through C and C#. 
     I'd like to learn more about Discord bot programming and automating daily processes and html to provide an easy way to see my storage usage.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic Python and C and C# in university first year.

- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment due to my nonexistent skill :^)

- 📫 How to reach me? Not today
